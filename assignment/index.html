    <ul>
    <li>I played in a punk band in high school. Now, thankfully, our recordings are long lost!</li>
    <li>When people hear I got an English Degree in college they always ask my favorite book, but I can never decide between 'The Remains of the Day' by Kazuo Ishiguro or 'Cloud Atlas' by David Mitchell. I loved them both and always recommend them!</li>
    <li>I was fortunate and found cheap tickets to Europe before Prime started. I backpacked through Italy and stopped in Lisbon and Dublin. The photo above is in Amalfi, Italy.</li>
